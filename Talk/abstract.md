# Using a Flipped Classroom in a Large Programming Course for Mathematicians

Should a modern Mathematician know how to write computer code? This question was recently answered positively by the School of Mathematics at Cardiff University.
This talk will describe the flipped classroom approach used in a new course delivered to all first year Mathematics students.
Certain formative assessment methodologies will be discussed that allow for a continuous feedback loop between instructor and learner.
